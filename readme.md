# Postman Collection Setup

I‚Äôve included a ready-to-use Postman collection to test the backend.

## ‚úÖ File Location:
The Postman collection file can be found at the following location in the repository:

/postman/Auth_comment_service.postman_collection.json

## How to Import the Collection:

1. **Download the File**
   - Navigate to the `postman` folder in the repo and download `levich-assignment.postman_collection.json`.

2. **Open Postman App**
   - Launch the Postman application on your machine.

3. **Import the Collection**
   - Click on **Import** in the top left corner of the Postman window.
   - Choose **Upload Files**, then select the downloaded `.json` file.

4. **Set Base URL**
   - Update the base URL for the requests.
   - If you are running the backend on a server, use the following URL:
     ```
     https://levich-assignment-1.onrender.com/
     ```
   - If you're running it locally, use:
     ```
     http://localhost:8000/
     ```

5. **Authorize (If Needed)**
   - After logging in, copy the `accessToken` from the response.
   - Use this token in the **Bearer Token** section or **Authorization Headers** in Postman for the requests that require authentication.
